# Hacked mlterm

This is a personal fork of [mlterm](https://github.com/arakiken/mlterm) with the following hacks:

* A `conf.sh` script for tracking a fairly minimized build configuration
* Hacky fix to get it working with [suckless tabbed](https://tools.suckless.org/tabbed/)
* Scroll wheel scrolls by 5 lines at a time (like xterm)
* Default word separators is just ' '
* Removed backscroll on arrow keys
